   Note that [get_linked_articles] should ONLY return things that look like wikipedia
   articles. In particular, we should discard links that are:

   - other Wikipedia internal URLs that are not articles
   - resources that are external to Wikipedia

   uniformity in article format. We can expect that all Wikipedia article links parsed
   from a Wikipedia page will have the form "/wiki/<TITLE>". *)
